<h2>Story:</h2>
<p>Set in the Golden Age of Piracy (1715), Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag follows Edward Kenway, a charming but reckless pirate captain with dreams of fortune and fame. As he sails through the lawless Caribbean, Edward becomes entangled in the ancient war between Assassins and Templars — two secret factions fighting for control over the future of humanity.

From the bustling ports of Havana and Nassau to the hidden coves of remote islands, Edward’s journey takes him across a vast open world filled with naval battles, treasure hunting, and historical legends like Blackbeard and Charles Vane. Torn between his own ambitions and the larger cause of freedom, Edward must decide what kind of legacy he wants to leave behind.

A tale of betrayal, freedom, and redemption, Black Flag delivers a gripping pirate saga at sea — with the heart of an Assassin.</p>
<h2>Total Players:</h2>
<p><ul>
    <b>PC</b>

<li>Worldwide, the game has reached over 34 million total players across all platforms.</li>

<li>Out of these, approximately 15 million copies have been sold on PC as of 2025.</li>

<li>SteamCharts data shows a consistent active base: currently around 580 concurrent players, with a 30-day average of ≈900 daily players.</li>

<li>While exact player count across all PC distribution channels (like Ubisoft Connect) isn’t publicly available, it’s clear that PC represents a significant portion—likely around 40–50% of the total player base.</li>

<b>PlayStation (PS3, PS4, PS5)</b>

<li>Ubisoft’s 34 million figure includes console players, but exact splits aren’t disclosed.</li>

<li>PS-Timetracker data (voluntary tracking) shows:</li>

<li>~3,301 tracked PS4 players.</li>

<li>~971 tracked PS5 players.</li>

<li>~130 tracked PS3 players.</li>
across their user sample totaling about 4,402 PS platform users.

This suggests PlayStation accounts for a substantial share, possibly 30–40% of all players.</ul></p>
